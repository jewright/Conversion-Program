# Conversion-Program
This program allows you to convert between nine types of measurements and contains a total of sixty-two units. It has a total of over 3,000 lines of code.

## How To Use
When you run this program, you will be asked the type of measurement conversion you would like to make. You can type in either the number or abbreviation. In this this tutorial, we'll use weight (enter a "w" or "1").

</p>

Next you will be asked the unit you are converting from and the unit you want to convert to. After inputting the abbreviations for both, you can enter all of the values you want. The amount of values won't matter nor will the number value (you can use positives, negatives, and decimals). If you change your mind about the measurement type, you can enter 0 to go back to the beginning. 

**Make sure your input is seperated by spaces.**

</p>
After you finish your input, you will receive an array of all the values converted. I have made it so that the returned values round to 4 decimals for more accuracy. 

Next you will be asked if you'd like make another conversion. Enter a "1" for yes or a "2" for no. If yes, you will go through the code again like you previously did. If you decide no, you will get a completion message.
