## How To Use
When you run this program, you will be asked the type of measurement conversion you would like to make. You can type in either the number or abbreviation. In this this tutorial, we'll use weight (enter a "w" or "1").

</p>

Next, you will choose the unit you are converting from and to. After inputting abbreviations for both, you can enter all the values you want. Additionally, you can use numbers of any value  (positives, negatives, and decimals). If you change your mind about the measurement type, you can enter 0 to return to the beginning.

**Your input must be separated by spaces.**

</p>
After you finish your input, you will receive an array of all the values converted and rounded to 4 decimals for more accuracy.

Next, you will decide if you'd like to make another conversion. Enter a "1" for yes or a "2" for no. If yes, you will go through the code again like you previously did. If you decide no, you will get a completion message.
